#### About the development of a bullying prediction model ####

From the GHSH, the survey questions related to bullying were selected. This is with the aim of developing a model that allows preventing it. Some of the indicators of bullying have been related to feelings of loneliness, lack of close friends, poor communication with parents, absence from classes. (eg.
