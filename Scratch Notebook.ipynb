    "\n",
    "From the GHSH, the survey questions related to bullying were selected. This is with the aim of developing a model that allows preventing it.\n",
    "Some of the indicators of bullying have been related to feelings of loneliness, lack of close friends, poor communication with parents, absence from classes. (eg. Nansel et al Bullying behaviors among US youth: Prevalence and association with psychosocial adjustment)\n",
